## Multiple object detection using pre trained model in TensorFlow.js

Inference is simply the act of taking some input and running it through the machine learning model
(essentially a lot of mathematical operations), and then providing some results. With the TensorFlow.js
pre-made models we return our predictions in the form of JSON objects, so it is easy to use.
