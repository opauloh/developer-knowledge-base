Sometimes We’re conforming to the
operational model of the machine by describing how we want to accomplish the
task. Instead, what if we took a more declarative approach ? Instead of
describing how we want to accomplish the task, let’s describe what we’re trying
to accomplish.This declarative approach will allow us to conform closer to the
mental model of the developer.
