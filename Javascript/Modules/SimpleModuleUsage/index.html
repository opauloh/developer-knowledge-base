<!-- 
  - CORS will block import if opening this file (thanksfully 🙏🏻, because we need to serve it from a server!)
  - We can start a serve locally by running `npx serve` in the terminal
  - We can't leave the extension of (.js), because node can interpret without extension, but the browser can't
  - We can import from any URL - Ex (import * as d3 from 'https://unpkg.com/d3?module';)
-->
<script type="module">
  import { appendDiv } from './append-div.js';
  appendDiv('Hello from inline script');
</script>
<script type="module" src="./script-src.js"></script>
