/*
In the minified production build of React, we avoid sending down full error messages in order to reduce the number of
 bytes sent over the wire.

We highly recommend using the development build locally when debugging your app since it tracks additional debug info
 and provides helpful warnings about potential problems in your apps, but if you encounter an exception while using the
  production build, this page will reassemble the original text of the error.

The full text of the error you just encountered is:

ni(...): Nothing was returned from render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing,
return null.



Possible solutions: you return nothing as result of rendermethod of you react component.
Return something else instead of it.
