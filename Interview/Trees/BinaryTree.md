A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children.

Not all trees are binary trees. For example, this tree is not a binary tree. You
could call it a ternary tree.

There are occasions when you might have a tree that is not a binary tree. For
example, suppose you were using a tree to represent a bunch of phone numbers. In
this case, you might use a 10-ary tree, with each node having up to 10 children
(one for each digit). A node is called a"leaf" node if it has no children.
